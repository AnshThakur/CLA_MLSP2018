Convex likelihood alignments

CLA framework utilizes acoustic
topic modelling to obtain an intermediate symbolic representation
where the discrimination between target classes is
more evident than in the input feature space. The proposed
framework utilizes the GMM as an acoustic topic model and
weighted likelihoods obtained from this GMM are utilized
as the intermediate symbolic representation. Class-specific
archetypal dictionaries are used to obtain the proposed feature
representation, designated as convex likelihood alignments
(CLAs), from this intermediate representation.
